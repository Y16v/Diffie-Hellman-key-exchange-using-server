Feature: Diffie-Hellman key exchange

    Scenario: Client randomly generate private key
        Given that I am client
        When I visit a web site
        Then I must send public key which was generated by private key

    Scenario: Server randomly generate private key
        Given that I am sever
        When client connected to server
        Then I must send public key which was generated by private key

     Scenario: Client/Server receives public key and using own private key defining common secret key
        Given that I am client/server
        When I receive public key
        Then I must using Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm define common secret key

    Scenario: Client encrypt message using Caesar cipher
        Given that I am client
        When I encrypt message using secret key
        Then I must send encrypted message to server

    Scenario: Client decrypt message using Caesar cipher
        Given that I am client
        When I receive encrypted message from server
        Then I must decrypted message using secret key

    Scenario: Server decrypt message using Caesar cipher
        Given that I am server
        When I receive encrypted message from client
        Then I must decrypted message using secret key

    Scenario: Sever encrypt message using Caesar cipher
        Given that I am server
        When I encrypt message using secret key
        Then I must send encrypted message to client
