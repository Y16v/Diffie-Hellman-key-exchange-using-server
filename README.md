# Diffie-Hellman-key-exchange-using-server
Diffie-Hellman-key-exchange-using-server is python built in socket project which shows how server and client

interact with each other and generates cryptographic keys for encrypting messages using Ceaser Cipher.

# Usage
In terminal type:

python -c 'import server; server.server()'
python -c 'import client; client.client()'

# Advantage Diffie-Hellman over RSA
Advantage of DH over RSA for generating ephemeral keys: producing a new DH key pair is extremely fast
